# OS-Short-Coding-Works
These are some short c implementations related to the usage of time functions, fork, execlp, and so on.

SC-1: usage of fork() and wait()
SC-2: usage of execlp for the command ps-f
SC-3: usage of sleep() function
SC-4: usage of strftime() , gettimeofday(), write() and read(). (Write() and read() are related to the interprocess communication logic with pipes.)
